# PMT

Welcome to the home page of the Predictive Mutation Testing(i.e., PMT).
In the paper we propose predictive mutation testing, the first approach to predicting mutation testing results without mutant execution. In particular, the proposed approach constructs a classification model based on a series of features related to mutants and tests, and uses the classification model to predict whether a mutant is killed or survived without executing it.
