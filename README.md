# PMT
PMT is the first approach to predicting mutation testing results without mutant execution. In particular, the proposed approach constructs a classification model based on a series of features related to mutants and tests, and uses the classification model to predict whether a mutant is killed or survived without executing it.  More specifically, PMT builds a predictive model by collecting a series of easy-to-get mutant features on already executed mutants, such as the coverage information of a mutated line, the mutation operator used to generate a mutant, and the return type of the method that contains a mutant. The already executed mutants, which are collected offline, compose a training set of instances each of which contains all features of the mutant as well as its execution result (i.e., killed or survived). Taking these collected data as input, based on certain machine learning algorithm (e.g., random forest), PMT builds a predictive model, which is used to predict whether a new mutant is killed or survived based on the same feature set as those of the training instances, i.e., without executing this new mutant at all.
